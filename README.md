# Radiocenter [DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE]
Sadly looks like csgo dev team managed to shut down that bug where we could prank our friends
CS:GO Radiocenter App
A small app i created for people to prank eachothers with fake CSGO chat messages, and capture their reactions!
The app is poor written since i'm still learning, and i learned alot during the journy of creating this app.

# How to make it .exe file
* run "pip install pyinstaller" in your cmd
* cd to the file location
* run "pyinstaller --onefile -w --icon=csgo.ico Radiocenter.py" in your cmd
* your exe copy will be in the "dist" folder created by pyinstaller
